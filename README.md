# StoreFront 

**StoreFront** is a simple and clean e-commerce web application built using Django. It allows users to register, log in, browse products, add them to a shopping cart, and manage quantities — all within a responsive Bootstrap-powered interface.

---

##  Features

-  User registration, login, and logout using Django’s authentication system  
-  Product listing with name, price, and image  
-  "Add to Cart" functionality with session-based storage  
-  View cart with product quantity, subtotal, and total amount  
-  Remove items or update quantities in the cart  
- Responsive UI using Bootstrap 4

## How It Works

1. Users register or log in to access the platform.  
2. Products are displayed using Bootstrap cards.  
3. Clicking “Add to Cart” stores items in session data.  
4. Cart shows all added items with quantity and subtotal.  
5. Users can remove items or change quantity as needed.
